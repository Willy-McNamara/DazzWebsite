Dazzle Website Project!

Trello Board here: ___

Summary:
I intend to create a simple web app for use by Alex and me. The prototype of this web app will allow Alex to upload images, GIFs, or animations,
and allow me to upload coordinating mp3's for those visual ideas.

Future Considerations:
One direction this could build to (off the top of my head), is a simple video game that allows Alex to upload the characters he wants to use.
Another could be something to do with generative art where the audio plays with the JPG that's been uploaded, etc.

v0:
For v0, I'd like to have a simple and clean design which allows for jpg and mp3 upload in groups from two Admins (Alex and me).
I'd also like to procure some dazzle-esque web domain to host this on, and figure out the annual cost to run a remote server for this site through AWS.
